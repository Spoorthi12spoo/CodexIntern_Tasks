# House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project predicts house prices based on features like number of rooms, size, location, and other important factors using a Linear Regression model.

## 1. Objective

To build a machine learning model that can accurately estimate house prices after preprocessing the dataset collected from Kaggle.

## 2.Technologies Used

Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn (train_test_split, LinearRegression, mean_squared_error, LabelEncoder)

## 3. Steps Followed

* Collected the dataset from Kaggle
* Cleaned and preprocessed the data
* Performed feature selection and encoding
* Trained a Linear Regression model
* Evaluated the model using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
* Predicted house prices on test data

## 4. How to Run

 * pip install pandas scikit-learn
 * python model.py

## 5. Results

The model gives reliable predictions based on the selected features.
